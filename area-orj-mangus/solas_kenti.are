                      The Sword of Justice balances the pans
                      Of right and wrong, and foul and fair
                      Eye for an eye, Doomgiver scans

But who doesn't like scuba diving. If you don't already have

scuba though. Something about a revoked teaching credential due to too
many students dying or something. This does seem to be an odd place to have
a scuba shop considering the sea is miles away. But I guess you could
always go diving in the lake. But why?....

Jander'in Ofisi~
   This is Jander's Office and obviously you didn't read the sign before
coming in.The office is dusty and abandon like the rest of the bar, but is
otherwise in the same condition as when it was occupied. An oak desk
sits in the middle of the room. A bookcase rests against the wall. Various
chairs are set in front of the desk. An employee that was called into Jander's
office was not likely to leave. Jander was rarely if ever seen. He mostly
stayed in his office and did office stuff. He was never in a good mood.
The office door is to the south.

This is the Reception area for the the Captain of the Guard. A large portrait
of the Captain is on the north wall. With the amount of extravagance and
expensive items that decorate this room you wonder how he gets away with
it. The title Sultan would be more appropriate than Captain of the Guard.
You see an oak door to the east.
There are a pair of glass double doors to the south.

Yönetim Koridoru~
The hallway is just as extravagant as all the others in this building.
Gem mosaics cover the walls, and intricate patterns are carved in the
gold laden floors. This doesn't look like an admistration building,
more like a palace.
The Captain of the Guard's waiting room is to the west.
