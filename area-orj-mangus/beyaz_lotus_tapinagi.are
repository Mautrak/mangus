This is a small stone path that leads to the temple garden. This is the
beginning of the gardens of Xiang Fung. He spent many hours here
tending to every flower and shrub. The garden here is so dense that
it blocks out the sky. Rays of light break through the canopy and
light the pathway. The path continues to the north.

This is a small stone path that leads to the temple garden. The garden here
is so dense that it blocks out the sky. Rays of light break through the
canopy and light the pathway. Something seems to be wrong here. The
flowers seem to be wilted and and shrubs dying. From the outside this
would appear to be a beautiful paradise of a garden. From the inside it
is seems to be dying. Almost as if the very heart of the garden were
poisoned. The path continues to the west.
