# Uzak Diyarlar MUD - Key Data Structures

This document provides an overview of the main data structures used in the Uzak Diyarlar MUD project. Understanding these structures is crucial for working with the codebase and implementing new features.

## Core Game Structures

### CHAR_DATA

The `CHAR_DATA` structure represents both player characters and NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in the game world.

Key components:
- Basic information (name, short description, long description)
- Statistics (hit points, mana, move points, experience, level)
- Equipment and inventory
- Skills and abilities
- Affected by (spells and other effects)
- Position and location in the game world

Defined in: `merc.h`

### OBJ_DATA

The `OBJ_DATA` structure represents in-game objects that players can interact with, carry, or use.

Key components:
- Basic information (name, short description, long description)
- Object type (weapon, armor, container, etc.)
- Value fields (used differently depending on object type)
- Wear flags (where the object can be worn or used)
- Extra flags (special properties of the object)
- Affected by (magical effects on the object)

Defined in: `merc.h`

### ROOM_INDEX_DATA

The `ROOM_INDEX_DATA` structure represents individual locations (rooms) in the game world.

Key components:
- Room name and description
- Exits to other rooms
- Characters and objects in the room
- Room flags (special properties of the room)
- Sector type (terrain type)

Defined in: `merc.h`

### AREA_DATA

The `AREA_DATA` structure represents larger areas in the game world, typically containing multiple rooms.

Key components:
- Area name and filename
- List of rooms in the area
- Area flags
- Reset information (for respawning monsters and objects)
- Author and creation information

Defined in: `merc.h`

## Supporting Structures

### AFFECT_DATA
Represents magical effects or skills affecting characters, objects, or rooms.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### DESCRIPTOR_DATA
Manages the connection between the player and the game server.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### MOB_INDEX_DATA and OBJ_INDEX_DATA
Template structures for creating NPCs and objects in the game world.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### PC_DATA
Additional data specific to player characters, not used for NPCs.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### MPROG_DATA and OPROG_DATA
Structures for managing mob (NPC) programs and object programs, allowing for custom scripted behaviors.

Defined in: `merc.h`

## Newly Identified Structures

### BAN_DATA
Manages banned player data.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### BUFFER
Handles string buffering for efficient memory management.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### HELP_DATA
Stores help file information.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### SHOP_DATA
Manages shop information for NPCs that can buy and sell items.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### QUEST_INDEX_DATA
Handles quest-related data.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### TIME_INFO_DATA
Manages in-game time information.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### WEATHER_DATA
Handles weather-related information for the game world.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### AUCTION_DATA
Manages the auction system data.

Defined in: `merc.h`

## Utility Structures

### reset_data
Manages area reset information.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### exit_data
Represents exits between rooms.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### extra_descr_data
Handles additional descriptions for objects and rooms.

Defined in: `merc.h`

### kill_data
Tracks kill statistics.

Defined in: `merc.h`

## Considerations for Future Development

1. Memory Management: The project uses custom memory allocation functions (see `recycle.c` and `recycle.h`). Consider evaluating modern memory management techniques for potential improvements.

2. Data Persistence: Review how data is saved and loaded in `save.c`, considering more efficient or flexible storage methods for future scalability.

3. Modularity: Some structures contain a large number of fields. Consider if some of these can be modularized or separated into sub-structures for better organization and maintainability.

4. Thread Safety: As the project may be expanded to handle more concurrent connections, evaluate the thread safety of these structures and their usage throughout the codebase, especially in `comm.c`.

5. Extensibility: Consider how new features or game mechanics might require extensions to these structures, and plan for backwards compatibility. The modular nature of structures like MPROG_DATA and OPROG_DATA provides a good example of extensible design.

6. JSON Integration: With the presence of `cJSON.c` and `cJSON.h`, consider leveraging JSON for data serialization and deserialization, which could simplify data management and provide more flexibility.

7. Documentation: Enhance inline documentation for these structures in `merc.h` to provide more context on their usage and relationships.

Understanding and properly utilizing these data structures is key to effectively working with and expanding the Uzak Diyarlar MUD codebase. Always refer to the actual implementation in the source files for the most up-to-date and detailed information.
