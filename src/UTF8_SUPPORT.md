# UTF-8 Support in Uzak Diyarlar MUD: Comprehensive Technical Analysis and Implementation Strategies

This document provides an in-depth technical analysis of the current state of character encoding in the Uzak Diyarlar MUD project, outlines the challenges and risks of implementing UTF-8 support, and proposes detailed strategies for implementation.

## Current State: Detailed Analysis

The Uzak Diyarlar MUD project currently has zero UTF-8 support. The codebase assumes ASCII encoding throughout, which presents significant challenges for proper Turkish language support. Let's break down the current state in detail:

### 1. String Handling

All string operations assume single-byte characters. This affects virtually every file in the project, but some key areas include:

- `handler.c`:
  ```c
  void affect_modify(CHAR_DATA *ch, AFFECT_DATA *paf, bool fAdd)
  {
      // ... (code that assumes single-byte characters in affect names and descriptions)
  }
  ```

- `comm.c`:
  ```c
  void write_to_buffer(DESCRIPTOR_DATA *d, const char *txt, int length)
  {
      // ... (code that doesn't account for multi-byte characters)
  }
  ```

- `act_comm.c`:
  ```c
  void do_say(CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument)
  {
      // ... (parsing and handling of speech that assumes ASCII)
  }
  ```

### 2. Network Communication

The `comm.c` file handles all network I/O using ASCII encoding:

```c
bool read_from_descriptor(DESCRIPTOR_DATA *d)
{
    int iStart;
    // ... (code that reads raw bytes without considering character boundaries)
}

bool write_to_descriptor(DESCRIPTOR_DATA *d, char *txt, int length)
{
    // ... (code that writes raw bytes without encoding consideration)
}
```

The telnet protocol implementation doesn't negotiate character encoding with clients:

```c
void nanny(DESCRIPTOR_DATA *d, char *argument)
{
    // ... (no negotiation for character encoding)
}
```

### 3. Data Storage

Files like `save.c` and database operations in `db.c` write and read data assuming ASCII encoding:

- `save.c`:
  ```c
  void fwrite_char(CHAR_DATA *ch, FILE *fp)
  {
      fprintf(fp, "Name %s~\n", ch->name);
      // ... (writes strings directly without encoding conversion)
  }
  ```

- `db.c`:
  ```c
  void load_char_obj(DESCRIPTOR_DATA *d, char *name)
  {
      // ... (reads strings directly without encoding consideration)
  }
  ```

### 4. Text Processing

Parsing functions in `interp.c` and command handlers in various `act_*.c` files assume single-byte characters:

- `interp.c`:
  ```c
  char *one_argument(char *argument, char *arg_first)
  {
      // ... (tokenization that assumes ASCII word boundaries)
  }
  ```

- `act_info.c`:
  ```c
  void do_look(CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument)
  {
      // ... (formatting and display code that assumes fixed-width characters)
  }
  ```

### 5. Game Content

All in-game text is likely stored and processed as ASCII. This includes:

- Room descriptions in `db.c`
- Object and NPC names and descriptions
- Help files and other game text

## Potential Breaking Points: Detailed Analysis

Implementing UTF-8 support will break numerous parts of the codebase. Here's an expanded technical breakdown of potential issues:

### 1. String Length Calculations

Current code (found in multiple files):
```c
int len = strlen(str);
```

Problems:
- Will return the number of bytes, not characters.
- Can lead to buffer overflows when allocating memory.
- May cause string truncation when limiting input or output.

Affected functions (examples):
- `string_add` in `string.c`
- `do_say` in `act_comm.c`
- `load_char_obj` in `db.c`

Potential solution:
```c
size_t utf8_strlen(const char *str)
{
    size_t len = 0;
    while (*str)
    {
        if ((*str & 0xC0) != 0x80) len++;
        str++;
    }
    return len;
}
```

### 2. Character Indexing

Current code (found in multiple files):
```c
char c = str[i];
```

Problems:
- May read a partial UTF-8 character.
- Can lead to incorrect character comparisons.
- Might cause data corruption when modifying strings.

Affected functions (examples):
- `colorize` in `comm.c`
- `nanny` in `comm.c`
- `one_argument` in `interp.c`

Potential solution:
```c
char *utf8_index(const char *str, int index)
{
    while (index > 0 && *str)
    {
        if ((*str & 0xC0) != 0x80) index--;
        str++;
    }
    return (char *)str;
}
```

### 3. Buffer Overflows

Current code (found in multiple files):
```c
char buf[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];
strncpy(buf, str, MAX_STRING_LENGTH - 1);
```

Problems:
- Fixed-size buffers may overflow with UTF-8 data.
- String truncation may occur in the middle of a multi-byte character.

Affected areas:
- Almost all string handling in the codebase.

Potential solution:
- Implement dynamic string handling.
- Use a custom string type that tracks both byte length and character count.

### 4. Network Communication

Current code in `comm.c`:
```c
write(d->descriptor, txt, strlen(txt));
```

Problems:
- May send partial UTF-8 characters.
- No encoding negotiation with clients.

Potential solution:
- Implement MTTS (Mud Terminal Type Standard) for encoding negotiation.
- Ensure all network writes are on character boundaries:

```c
size_t utf8_safe_write(int fd, const char *buf, size_t len)
{
    const char *end = buf + len;
    while (end > buf && ((*end & 0xC0) == 0x80)) end--;
    return write(fd, buf, end - buf);
}
```

### 5. File I/O

Current code in `save.c`:
```c
fprintf(fp, "%s~\n", pc->name);
```

Problems:
- Writes UTF-8 data as-is, potentially causing issues when reading back.
- No BOM (Byte Order Mark) for UTF-8 files.

Potential solution:
- Add UTF-8 BOM to the beginning of saved files.
- Implement UTF-8 aware reading and writing functions.

### 6. Text Comparison

Current code (found in multiple files):
```c
if (str1[i] == str2[i])
```

Problems:
- Byte-by-byte comparison will fail for UTF-8 characters.
- Case-insensitive comparisons won't work for non-ASCII characters.

Affected areas:
- Command parsing in `interp.c`
- Name lookups in `lookup.c`

Potential solution:
- Implement UTF-8 aware comparison functions:

```c
int utf8_strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2)
{
    while (*s1 && *s2)
    {
        uint32_t ch1 = utf8_next_char(&s1);
        uint32_t ch2 = utf8_next_char(&s2);
        if (ch1 != ch2) return ch1 - ch2;
    }
    return *s1 - *s2;
}
```

### 7. Character Case Conversion

Current code (found in multiple files):
```c
if (LOWER(ch) == 'i')
```

Problems:
- Won't handle Turkish-specific case conversion.
- Case-insensitive comparisons will be incorrect for Turkish text.

Affected areas:
- Name matching in `lookup.c`
- Command parsing in `interp.c`

Potential solution:
- Implement locale-aware case conversion:

```c
uint32_t turkish_lower(uint32_t ch)
{
    if (ch == 'I') return 'ı';
    if (ch == 'İ') return 'i';
    // ... (other Turkish-specific rules)
    return towlower(ch);
}
```

## Technical Challenges for Implementation

### 1. Memory Management

The project uses custom memory allocation (e.g., in `recycle.c`). These functions need to be reviewed and modified:

```c
void *alloc_mem(int sMem)
{
    // ... (needs to account for potentially larger UTF-8 strings)
}

void free_mem(void *pMem, int sMem)
{
    // ... (needs to correctly free UTF-8 aware structures)
}
```

### 2. String Library

A complete UTF-8 aware string library needs to be implemented. This should include functions for:

- Character counting
- Substring extraction
- String concatenation
- String comparison (including collation)
- Case conversion

Example of a UTF-8 character iteration function:

```c
uint32_t utf8_next_char(const char **ptr)
{
    const unsigned char *s = (const unsigned char *)*ptr;
    uint32_t ch = *s++;
    if (ch >= 0x80)
    {
        int extra = utf8_char_length[ch];
        ch &= utf8_first_byte_mask[extra];
        for (int i = 0; i < extra; i++)
        {
            uint32_t tmp = *s++;
            ch = (ch << 6) | (tmp & 0x3F);
        }
    }
    *ptr = (const char *)s;
    return ch;
}
```

### 3. Input Parsing

The command interpreter in `interp.c` needs to be completely overhauled. This includes:

- Tokenization that respects UTF-8 character boundaries
- Case-insensitive matching that works with Turkish characters
- Handling of UTF-8 input in all command functions

### 4. Database Schema

If the project uses a database, the schema may need to be updated:

- Change character columns to support UTF-8 (e.g., `VARCHAR` to `NVARCHAR` in SQL Server)
- Update any stored procedures or queries that manipulate strings

### 5. Client-Server Protocol

The network protocol needs to be updated to negotiate and handle UTF-8 encoding:

- Implement MTTS (Mud Terminal Type Standard)
- Add a handshake phase to determine client encoding support
- Implement fallback mechanisms for clients that don't support UTF-8

### 6. Text Rendering

Any code that formats text for display needs to be rewritten:

- Word wrapping that respects UTF-8 character boundaries
- Text alignment that accounts for variable-width characters
- Handling of bidirectional text if supporting multiple languages

## Risk Assessment

1. Data Corruption:
   - Risk: High
   - Impact: Critical
   - Mitigation: Implement robust validation for all UTF-8 input/output

2. Security Vulnerabilities:

5. Partial Implementation:
   - Risk: High
   - Impact: High
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite, phased implementation approach

## Recommended Approach

Given the extensive changes required, a phased approach is recommended:

1. Develop Core UTF-8 Library:
   - Implement basic UTF-8 string operations
   - Create a new string type that's UTF-8 aware
   - Unit test extensively

2. Update I/O Layer:
   - Modify `comm.c` to handle UTF-8 input/output
   - Implement encoding negotiation with clients
   - Update file I/O in `save.c` and `db.c`

3. Refactor String Handling:
   - Gradually replace all string operations with UTF-8 aware versions
   - Start with core files like `handler.c` and `interp.c`
   - Update game content loading to handle UTF-8

4. Update Game Logic:
   - Modify command parsing and execution to handle UTF-8
   - Update text formatting and display functions
   - Implement Turkish-specific case conversion and comparison

5. Data Migration:
   - Develop tools to convert existing game data to UTF-8
   - Plan and execute a data migration strategy

6. Testing and Refinement:
   - Develop a comprehensive UTF-8 test suite
   - Conduct thorough testing, including edge cases and stress tests
   - Refine and optimize based on test results

7. Gradual Rollout:
   - Implement a feature flag system for UTF-8 support
   - Roll out to a subset of users for initial testing
   - Monitor closely and address any issues before full rollout

## Conclusion

Implementing UTF-8 support in the Uzak Diyarlar MUD project is a complex and high-risk undertaking that will touch almost every part of the codebase. It requires careful planning, extensive refactoring, and rigorous testing. However, it's necessary for proper Turkish language support and future internationalization efforts.

The phased approach outlined above, while time-consuming, provides the best balance of risk mitigation and progress. It allows for incremental improvements and easier rollback if issues are encountered.

Regular backups, version control best practices, and continuous integration will be crucial throughout this process. Additionally, clear communication with the player base about potential disruptions and the benefits of the upgrade will be important for a smooth transition.

This document should be treated as a living guide, updated as the implementation progresses and new challenges or solutions are discovered.
