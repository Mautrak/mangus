The coven raids the\nlumber operation and takes blood sacrifice for their devil. Players\nshould wander into town and piece together this part of the adventure\nby looking at the various mobs. In town they will find a shovel, which\nwill allow them into an old mine which leads to the temple guardian.\nThere is some subtlety here- for instance, if they count corpses in the\nglade, they will count 11 bodies, but both through mobs and on the new\nsign in the mill, the villagers are missing only 10 people, so one of\nthe bodies is not from Dunkeldorf. If they examine bodies, on one they\nwill find branded a pentagram, which shows that one was a witch\nimpostor. So If the players are smart, they can piece together that the\nwitches impersonated lumberjacks and sabotaged them (and there might be\none right now in Dunkeldorf- there is in the inn). The guardian is a\nprophecy threshold, if the heroes pass they can gain a key (the gold\nsickle) which will cut through the magic hedge surrounding the coven.\nOnce in the coven, they discover the horrible truth of the witchcraft\npractice of blood sacrifice. If they are playing good guys, they should\nslay all of the witches. From there they can move on to the fire, which\nis pick proof from inside, and the devil carries the key. IF they kill\nthe devil, they escape with otherworldly treasure.\n"

He said the exit would be hidden from all\nbut the chosen ones. You have come through. Show me you are worthy\nhero, and best me in combat.
