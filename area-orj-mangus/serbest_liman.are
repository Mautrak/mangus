You are in the shipyards of Freeport. About you in dry storage are many
vessels either in repair or in the process of being developed. Of particular
interest is the deep-keeled prototype vessel currently under construction.
You get the sense that sailing as you know it is about to change. Many of
the islanders are employed here, and ages range from the youthful 12 year
old apprentice, to the grizzled old shipwrights.

You have entered the grand arch of the merchants guild of Freeport. It is
here that the master traders conduct their business of contracting with
captains for the transport of cargo to remote destinations. Each member of
the merchant's guild tithes to the guild, money which is used to not
only maintain the guild proper, but also to open new markets in foreign
lands. The guild masters command much respect, wealth, and power throughout
the world. Guild matters are decided by a vote, scaled by the wealth of
each master. The 5 richest masters make up the council of 5, and argue on
the guilds behalf in contractual negotiations in town meetings. It has been
said that the council of 5 collectively owns one quarter of the world's
wealth.

Bahriye Akademisi~
You stand on the grounds of the renowned naval academy of Freeport, the
training grounds for the worlds captains. Young boys are taught for a
period of 8 years the art of sailing, and finish their apprenticeship onboard
actual military vessels. The academy has a long tradition of turning out
fine sailors. Most cadets eventually become captains of their own vessels
and under contract to the Merchants guild.

Here in the halls of the Captains guild, the worlds shipping begins and
ends. The guild was founded over 300 years ago to represent the collective
interests of the ship owners. To be a member, one must demonstrate the
clear title to at least one vessel. Ahead of you is the great hall where
the guild holds its meetings. Votes in the guild are based weighted by
the number of vessels the captain has. The richest men with the most ships
fill the 9 seats of honor in the guild, and are called the Admirals. It has
been said that they control one third of the world's shipping.

You have boldly entered the secret cave of the 6th pirate lord. About
you the evidence of his terrible crimes abounds. Here is a pilfered
