See where\nyou think you fit in.\n\nLawful Good:   An orderly, strong society with a well-organized government\n               can make life better for the majority of the people.  To ensure\n               the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed.  When\n               people respect the laws, and try to help each other, society as\n               whole prospers.\n\nLawful Neutral:  Also believes in a strong, well-organized government, whether\n               it is a tyranny or democracy.  Organization and regimentation\n               bring benefits that outweigh any moral questions raised by\n               their actions.\n\nLawful Evil:   The use of society and its laws for personal benefit.  Structure\n               and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as\n               provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant.\n               Laws and societies are supported so long as they fit with\n               personal concerns.  Laws are obeyed out of fear of punishment.\n\nNeutral Good:  A balance of forces is important, but the concerns of laws and\n               chaos do not moderate the need for good.  The universe is vast\n               and contains many creatures striving for different goals, so a\n               pursuit of good will not upset the balance.  Fostering good may\n               mean supporting an organized society, or overthrowing the\n               existing social order.  Social structure has no innate value.\n\nTrue Neutral:  Almost impossible to find such people as the majority of people\n               make judgments.  It is their duty to see that all of the forces\n               (evil, good, law, and chaos) remain in balance.  Alliances with\n               such people are odd, as they tend to switch sides as one side\n               brings the other to the point of destruction.\n\nNeutral Evil:  The primary concern for such people is their own advancement.\n               Working with others or on their own, their only interest is\n               getting ahead.  Such people are known for their 'Me, Myself,\n               and I' personalities.  No scruples, no conscience.\n\nChaotic Good:  Strong individualists marked with a streak of kindness and\n               benevolence.  Goodness and right matter, but there is little\n               use for laws and regulations.  Their actions are morally good\n               but may not be in perfect agreement with the rest of society.\n\nChaotic Neutral:  There is no order to anything, even their own actions.\n               Good and Evil are irrelevant when making a decision.  They\n               are almost totally unreliable, except for the fact that you\n               can rely on them being like this.  The true coin-flipper, they\n               rely on fate and chance to lead them.\n\nChaotic Evil:  The bane of all that is good and organized.  Laws and\n               governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for\n               themselves.  The strong have a right to what they want, and\n               weak are there to be exploited.  Leadership among CEs is based\n               on power, with the leader capable of bullying his underlings\n               into obedience.\n\nEach god may accept a follower based on these outlines.\n"

The law comes first in all respects.\n        They control and decide what is lawful or not.  Their word is law.\n\nBattleRager:  BattleRagers live for combat, and look down on those who need\n              magic to survive.  They have a strong aversion to mage magic,\n              and are very wary of clerical magic.\n\nChaos:    Chaos wants to spread chaos throughout the land.  Not necessarily\n          evil, just against the orderwed society.  They feel that laws and\n          rules hamper freedom, and will go out of their way to see them\n          broken, or to cause chaos.\n\nKnight:   Honor is valued above all else.  These fighting warriors seek to\n          right injustices and correct wrongs.  They follow the ideals of\n          the paladin.\n\nShalafi:  In Dark-Elf language, it means 'Master'. Discipline brings power.\n          This is the motto of the Masters of Arcane Arts. The advancement\n          of the Art is their motivation.  They look down on physical combat,\n          preferring to use their magic.\n\nInvader:  Invader is born to invade or massacre.  Establishment of its power\n          over all is its goal.  Invader, in short, wants to control the world,\n          but would never do so openly.\n\nHunter:   Mercenary of Anatolia. These pupils  kill any mobile and player\n          with the money that they will want. You may hire any of hunter\n          for above purpose.\n\nKeep in mind these are only general guidelines.\nSee also: CABAL\n"
