Additional code\nwas written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions\nand ideas from the Merc list were used.\n\nThe new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with\nGabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't\nhave happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and\nwiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.\n\nChanges to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes\nto Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of\nhair-pulling.

An absolute rule of immortal behavior is\nthat no immortal can aid or assist any player without explicit permission from\nthe higher ranks; in other words, please don't ask an immortal to help you kill\na mob, gather EQ, etc, or you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused,\nor referred to this file.\n\n        The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,\nare topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are\nfraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)\n"

It is not complete yet.\n\nANGELS (92-94):\n\n        Angels and higher level gods may not assist mortals directly in any way.\nAn angels' main job is controling the roleplaying of the game. Mostly each angle\nis responsible for one cabal. Responsibility means here that making sure that\nthe cabal members are acting according to the roleplaying theme. But an angel\ncannot induct a player to his/her cabal, unless there is no mortal cabal leader\nof that cabal. An angel may have a mortal char as well. But he/she cannot help\nhis/her mortal char in any sense. Violation of this rule is instant deletion!\n\nDEITIES (95-96):\n\n        Deities have two main roles: reimbursement and quest running. Be\nskeptical on reimburses, don't just hand out every piece of gear. I suggest\nlimiting reimbursements to 10 items at a time, and make sure that you do not\nload things at too high a level (new format items have hard-coded levels, so\nare not a problem).  Vnum and stat are useful for this.  DON'T FORGET THAT\nYOU CANNOT LOAD LIMITED ITEMS! You can draft Angels to help you run a quest,\nand please note that quests should NOT have huge rewards -- the main point\nshould be to have fun.  Deities have no business trying to enforce rules --\nthe most you should do to a player is a NOCHANNEL or similar light punishment.\nUsing the snoop command, Deities can keep track of players whether they are\nobeying the rules of roleplaying or not. Deities cannot have mortal characters.\n\nGODS (97-99):\n\n        Gods can run quests just like Deities and it's nice to do reimbursements\ntoo. However, the main role of a God is keeping the peace and enforcing the\nthe roleplaying, using the various NOTELL-class commands, as well as deny,\npurge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these commands!)  Gods are expected\nto help make the mud run more smoothly, power trips are strictly verbotten.\nNot fufilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion. Gods\ncannot have mortal characters.\n"

You don't need to win brownie\n    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items\n    isn't.\n\n7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT\n    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some\n    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels\n    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).\n\n8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you\n    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore\n    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.\n\n9)  Do not try to overrule each other.\n\n10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal\n    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.\n\n11) Take care of limited objects and quests.\n\n12) Make sure that everyone is obeying the roleplaying rules.\n\n"
