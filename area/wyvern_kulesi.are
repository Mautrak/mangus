Zýrhçý~
In this room, which has somehow evaded the ravages of time, are neatly stored
racks of common weapons.  They appear to be quite ordinary; however, a chest
in one corner catches your eye.  The only exit is the way you came in.

Subay Bölümü~
You have entered a lavish but functional room decked out in a military style.
Murals on the wall show battle scenes in gargoyles, minotaurs, and huge,
flying snake-like reptiles with poisonous tails fight humans and dwarves.
Various objects in the room give evidence that it is occupied by individuals
of authority.  The only door is north.

Doðu Kulesinin Üçüncü Katý~
You are in the center of the Eastern Tower's third floor.  The room you are in
glows with a mysterious light that has no source.  In the center of the room a
ladder climbs up to a hatchway in the ceiling.  The hatchway is a strange
looking keyhole.  There is also a door to the west.

You are outdoors on a catwalk between the turrets of the eastern and

a fabulous view of the surrounding countryside, which consists of a bleak
wilderness.  At the east end of the catwalk is a small opening leading
inside the eastern turret.  At the western end, a strange mirror-like portal
leads into the western turret.

Diðer Tarafta~
You are outdoors on a catwalk between the turrets of the Eastern and Western
towers.  There is no opening into the western tower of any kind.  You have a
fabulous view of your surroundings, a murky city partially obscured by strange
smoke that creeps along the ground instead of rising. The city stretches as far
as the eye can see under the conditions.
