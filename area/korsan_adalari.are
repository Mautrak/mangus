nudged him and he broke out of his block. With Rainman
doing the main debugging and alot of dark beer, this
area was created for your amusement. The secret to sailing
is that all simple seas never border on grounding reefs.
If you are in shallows type exit after each move to look
for shoals ( they wont show in the night ). There is a main
clockwise current running in the high seas, so don't sleep
on the high seas, or you will drift.. There are alot of
clues throughout isles so don't just powermud and miss all.
Lok charmed me so you wouldn't just mindlessly butcher me.'

Your boat gently rocks in the quiet lagoon of the atoll. Around you
are docked the ships of the pirate lords. Each ship is tied to a
pile sunk deep into the lagoon, and rope bridges connect all into
a makeshift wharf. To the south are several huts on stilts, connected
by rope bridges. The waters are calm enough to swim in here.

the pirates complex. Below you though the cracks in the flooring
you can see the waves lapping at the support piles. To the west
is a barred shack, and to the east, you can make out the shack
which houses most of the pirates. To the south, a large house stands
on stilts.

inscription strange rock~
Carved into the rock in wizard runes is the following:
` BEWARE-Enchanted Lodestone: I was on holiday on this
deserted island, practicing on my enchantment spells,
when in the middle of casting, I was rudely interrupted by
a mystic summons. The interruption threw my spell off target
and onto the island itself. With a wrenching crunch the whole
island rose from the sea to the position you find it now.
Intrigued by the phenomena I took a sample of the rock back
to my shack in the Forest Arden, where I determined by
methods of alchemy that the island had rich deposits of
lodestone, which when subjected to enchantment magic, flies.
I have used this discovery to create several floating trinkets
which impart the ability of flying to the recipient. Beware
for I know not how long this enchantment will last. - MERLIN'

Büyük Buzul Maðarasýnýn Ýçindeki Þenlik Ateþinin Dibi~
You stand next to a roaring bonfire in the great ice cavern. Logs some ten
feet in length are stacked crosswise to a height of 5'. The flames warm and
light the cavern, and most importantly, your backside. Bedrolls are cast
about the fire, and primitive shelving has been carved into the surrounding
stalagmites. The heat from the fire is so great that it has melted the ice into
a pool of water.

You have invaded the private hall of the Pirate Lord. Here, in this smaller
cavern, the walls have been covered with tapestries of depicting woodland
hunting scenes. A canopied bed is on the eastern half of the room, and a desk
on the western half. Two fires are lit here, well illuminating the room.
Carpeting covers the floor shorn of its stalagmites. Your spells flicker and
dim here. A rope ladder leads up.
