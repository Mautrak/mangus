þeytan keþiþ~
þeytan keþiþ~
Cüppeli keþiþ seni görünce hýrlýyor!
~
The fanatic monks of the Unholy Abbey despise all other people, especially
intruders in their sanctum! And you can rest assured they will do their
utmost to eject you!

kil golem heykel~
kil golem~
Kilden yapýlmýþ bir heykel hareketsiz seni izliyor.
~
This statue isn't very well-fashioned, and isn't very attractive. You wonder
why even the unholy monks would use such art in their abbey. Shrug.

keþiþ efendi~
efendi~
Siyahlara bürünmüþ monk efendisi sessizce seniz izliyor.
~
The master monks are the teachers and supervisors of the monks of the abbey,
and answer only to the abbot himself. They are if anything more diabolical
than their demented pupils, and twice as deadly.

necromancer~
a necromancer~
A frail old man clad in purple robes casts evil incantations here.
~
The abbey employs several necromancers to create their legions of undead,
with which they one day intend to conquer the kingdom of Malathar. They are
horrid, twisted, decrepit old men, who have incredible magical powers.
~
human~

#30804
baþrahip~
baþrahip~
Lanetli baþrahip çýðlýklarýyla sana lanetler okuyarak saldýrýyor!
~
The abbot is a vile, despicable old tyrant who rules his damned abbey with
an iron fist and a lust for conquest and death bordering on the maniacal.
He may be a shrivelled old man, but he is still immensely powerful.
~
human~

wight~
a wight~
A leering wight leaps to attack you.
~
The necromancers of the abbey have animated the remains of Knights of
Malathar slain by the monks and transformed them into horrid wights, and
additionally infusing them with a manic desire to slay everyone they behold.
~
human~

kemik iblis~
kemik iblis~
Kemiklerden oluþmuþ bir iblis üzerine geliyor!
~
The monks frequently summon devils to aid them in their evil schemes, and
their favorite is the bone devil, who only demands seven virgins rather than
the many scores other devils demand.

çora bakire~
çora bakire~
Çýrýlçýplak vücuduyla bir çora bakire mimbere zincirlenmiþ.
~
The monks capture and sacrifice female çora virgins to summon devils from
the Hells. This one has gone quite insane from the pain and shock of capture
and subsequent subjection to the cruel rituals of the monks.
~

cüce köle~
cüce köle~
Bir cüce durmadan çalýþýyor.
~
The monks may be powerful warriors but they are no engineers, so they capture
dwarves from the north and use them in this capacity, to expand and strengthen
their abbey.
~

ogre köle efendisi~
Ýrice bir ogre kýrbacýný sallayarak emirler veriyor.
~
This overconfident brute is one of many employed by the monks to keep their
slaves in line. He rashly expects you to just lie down and die for him. Hmmm.

This hapless fellow was captured by the old Dragon Clan many centuries ago
and imprisoned here. The new clan has not dared to disturb him, for they
know of his power.

~
This old çora, one Felthesres by name, is one of the bards of Malathar who has
vowed to remain here and await the return of the Paladin Grimafax from his
missions. He has been waiting several centuries, and will be waiting for
much longer before Grimafax returns.

This wyvern is a scout for the monks of the abbey, you surmise. Then again
it could be a perfectly normal wyvern that just happens to be wearing a
massive green amulet with "dragon clan" written on it...

Dik ve Pütürlü Yol~
You are ascending steadily upwards through rough terrain towards a large,
jagged mountain far to the north. There is a small rock resting here, near
the path, which could serve as a passable chair. There is a sign nailed to
a dead tree that hangs over the rock.

You reach the edge of the chasm, and stare across at the Tor. Sure enough,
you can see the abbey, nestled in a small crack that divides the top third
of the tor in two. It appears to have no doors or windows, and you can't
see any way across. You think you can see a black shape nestled atop the
abbey.

You are heading round the edge of the chasm. You can see no way across it
from here, though you could perhaps proceed across or down if you could
fly. You can still see the Tor, and the abbey at its summit. The black
shape is still hovering atop it.

comfort.

You fall into what appears to be a giant BBQ. You cringe and leap in the
air as your feet encounter burning piles of coal and other materials. It is
HOT in here!

Ölüm Laboratuvarý~
You walk into a dank, smelly chamber full of tables stacked with body parts.
Feeble illumination comes from a weak light spell cast on some rods of
mithril; besides that the room is almost completely dark. Doors lead east,
west and north.

Hücreler~
Here the Necromancers store the results of their twisted experiments on some
captured çora knights. They howl and scream so much that even their
creators are scared of them.

This 40'x40' room has the usual two portals, save that here there is no
lock on the one set in the roof. In fact you can walk right into it from
here should you so desire. Hmmm...

Arched hallways run east, south and north, while a door bars passage westward.

you slowly walk along the passage. An eerie feeling comes over you, and you
shiver. Distant chanting can be heard, as well as the occasional tolling
of a large bell. You hear more chanting, then a terrible scream. Oh dear...

You are standing in the west wing, among pews stained with blood and other
fluids, most of them unidentifiable. A great cry goes up to the east. You
peer in that direction and- OH MY GOD!

Lanetli Kilise~
It is here that the monks perform their unholy rites, summoning unnameable
horrors from the deepest pits of hell. You see sick murals covering the
walls, depicting the sacrifice of youths of all races to perverted, twisted
demons and devils.

Mimber~
You have reached the core of the evil, and the wicked heart that pulses the
energy through it. Though you have battled scores of opponents, rarely have
you previously encountered such evil. Foul ichor spews from gashes in the
walls of this place, coalescing into a floating portal to some netherworld
you know naught of. But you soon will, for it is there that you must next
travel, to rid the world of this evil!

the upcoming battle if you desire.

These rooms, as you expected, are lavishly appointed with rich tapestries
and fine furniture from all over the world. You didn't think the abbot would
live so simply as his followers! You see a bathroom to the east, a study
to the south and a massive bedchamber to the north.

This study is more of a library, filled as it is with scores of grimoires
detailing the most despicable acts imaginable. A small desk, not dissimilar
to those you saw the maste rmonks using below, stands in the center of the
room, near a fireplace which burns magically without requiring fuel.
