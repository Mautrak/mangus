Other than that, an\nElves fate in their very long lives is determined by their birth. While this\nmay seem unfair to those used to a more flexible system, the Elves have no\nproblem with the glass ceiling.\n\nThere is perfect sexual equality in Elven society, though in general the\nmales favor areas such as the warrior or magic arts, and females prefer the\npriesthood or healing arts.

Clan warfare is not common as in Drow Society; this is\nnot to say it is non-existent (far from it!) but that conflicts are more\ngenerally resolved through a system of bribes and blackmail rather than\narmobed combat (physical and mental).\n\nFew illithids will ever resort to performing menial tasks (to them, anything\nthat involves physical effort is too menial), as they have a large body of\nmind-controlled slaves of several other races for this. In fact, one of the\ngravest insults one can hurl at an Illithid is to insinuate he or she has\never performed manual labor.\n\nThe sexes are equally represented at all levels in Illithid society, perhaps\nmore than in any other society, as physical prowess is irrelevant, and in\nmental powers females can easily match (or surpass) males.\n"

Then the Humans and Dwarves stormed the once-lush forests of\nAnon, in search of Elves, and many thousands of acres of woodland was turned\nto barren waste in their relentless march. The Dryads grew angry, and emerged\nfrom their hidden realm, proving their existence to startled mortals who had\npreviously thought them to be legend.\n\nUsing their great powers and reputation, the Dryads brought the war to a halt,\na relatively easy task as the Humans and Dwarves were then still relatively\nsmall in numbers and weak in magical skills. They did not do so out of\nsympathy for the Elves, for the Elves had scorned the Dryads when they arrived\nas if they were but simple primitives living wild in the forests. They did so\nto preserve what was left of their sacred woodlands.\n\nSince that day, Dryads have begun to interact with the races they once shunned,\nand have found much to love in them, especially the Kender, of whom they are\nexceedingly fond.

They concentrated their settlements in the dense woodlands that then\ncovered most of Anon, or build beautiful crystal fortresses high in the\nwestern mountains that seperate Anon from the Desert wastes.\n\nCenturies passed, and gradually the Elves fell from dominance, losing interest\nin the pursuit of power and wealth, and instead immersing themselves in the\nstudy of the magical arts. Generations of such research eventually resulted\nin the evolution of a race of Elves of which every member possessed latent\nmagical talent, the ability to shape and mold the magical energies which\nflowed across Anon into whatever usage pleased them.\n\nThus eventually the Elves became renowned mages, and kings and princes of all\nraces sought them for their abilities, as well as their counsel, for Elves\nwere counted among the wisest of all races, save the Dryad. And the Elves\nprospered, and lived in realtive harmony with their neighbors.\n\nEventually, discord began to emerge, caused as is often the case by the\njealousy of the \"lesser\" races, and war between Elves and the other races\nbroke out. Combined armies of Dwarves and Humans drove Elves from their\nforests and their crystal palaces, at the cost of countless lives on both\nsides, for the Elves did not surrender their lands easily.\n\nThis war raged for thirty years, until it was ended by the coming of the\nDryads, who were angered at the desecration of their beloved forests by Human\nand Dwarf, and a peace was negotiated, for the mysterious dryads were greatly\nrespected and feared. The races returned to their domains, and have since that\nday maintained an uneasy truce, though in truth many members of the warring\nraces still hold a deep hatred for the others. Some say the Elves' natural\narrogance and condescension to the \"lesser\" races brought about the war-\nothers say it was the natural aggression of the Dwarves and Humans. Who is\nto say?\n"

This land had all sorts of\nthings from avians (bird people) to zombies (undead humanoids). It was a\ngreat place for a person to start a life of adventure.\n\n        But as time went on, and more people entered The Realms, storms were\nseen on the horizon and blow through The Realms causing disasters and\ndeaths. These storms were not natural storms, but rather magical in\nnature. As the storm raged, they dissappeared jsut as quick as they\ncame, and it seemed to all like the gods were starting to change.\n\n        As time went on, these 'storms' got worse, and soon it was\nnoticed that the 'storms' were caused by the strife between the gods and\ngoddesses. With each passing 'storm' the gods and godesses were becoming\nmeaner and more bitter to the people that were living in The Realms.\n\n        Feenix Flarestar was born into this world shortly after it was\ncreated, and chose the path of the Elf, the Master of offensive magic.\nFeenix was an acomplished youg çora, killed many a monster, and died even\nmore time than he killed (but that is story for another time). He learned\nthe ropes of adventuring in The Realms rather quickly, and made many\nfriends, both mortal and  godly.\n\n        As time went on, Feenix brought many other friends into the\nRealms. The sneaky Kender Mara, the strong but stupid dwarf (MadDog), and\nthe pretty, but lethal kender, Genivieve. These were valued friends, and\neven more valuable allies, in fighting the evil monster that inhabitated\nThe Realms.\n\n        As the months came and went, Feenix started noticing certain\nproblems, certain 'storms' so to speak. Feenix, being the quisitive type,\nstarted to ask questions, but would not get any answers.\n\n        Finally after many many battles, he made it to the ultimate\nmortal phase of life, Hero. Being a hero was all that really mattered to\nhim, however, the gods and goddesses have started to change the rules,\nand not telling their heroes as to why or what they were. It was then\nmade clear, that even though they said that Policies and Politics had no\nplce in The Realms, they were sadly mistaken. Policies and Politics was\nALL there was in The Realms.\n\n        As herohood went on for Feenix, he started to notice that things\nwere starting to get out of hand, starting to get ridicoulus, and the\nfeeling of wanderlust was starting up again.\n\n        Feenix left The Realms and headed out into space, looking for\nmore adventure. After many failed attempts at finding it, he located a\nplace called Anon. He entered the world as an Çora once again, and started\nhis adventuring career.\n\n        As he slowly progressed, he started to notice that the gods and\ngoddesses here were some of the same ones as from The Realms. This maded\nFeenix become a little uneasy. However, he soon found out that THESE Gods\nand Goddesses were far more friendly, and more attentive to the mortals,\nthan the other, nameless gods have ever been.\n\n        That is what brings Feenix here today. Just going with the flow\nof things. Asking questions (even though some are rather stupid), help\nwhen he can, and wondering...   Will the storms return?\n"

It is said that their parents were one of the original\nsettlers who came through magical portals to found a village\nknown in these times as Kendermore.  Pleasure and Pain are said to be\ntwin brother and sister, born to common parents.  They were the first born\nin the new lands and were the joy of the new village.\n   After a year of life in Kendermore, wanderlust began to settle into\ntheir father and other members of the community.  There was a great split\namong the kender, for some had lost their wanderlust and wanted to remain\nin their village but others wanted to wander the lands.  Until this day\nkender always travelled as a group, moving from location to location.\n   After much debate the matter was settled.  Any kender that wished to\nleave the village was free to do so and any that wished to remain could do\nso. For Pain and Pleasure it was a difficult time, for their father wished\nto wander while their mother wanted to remain in Kendermore.  The parents\nwere distraught and torn between their desires and their love for\ntheir children.\n   It was decided that neither parent should be without the company of one\nof their children.  Pain was to travel with their father and Pleasure was\nto remain with their mother.\n   Pain grew up always arms length from the hate, the death and the pain\nof the realm.  She felt the pain that her father lived with as he\nstruggled with his love for her mother and she felt the pain of being\nseparate from her twin, Pleasure.\n   Pleasure was raised as the child of the village.  The village filled\nPleasure with the joy and happiness of life.  But Pleasure always\nremembered the joy that he felt as a young child playing with his twin,\nPain.  One day, he felt the need to find his sister and left the village.\n   On that same day Pain left her father in search of her brother.  They\nwandered aimlessly through the realms searching for their kin.  All this\ntime they struggled with the violence and the horrors of the lands and\nacquired near-godlike skills and strength.\n   On the day that they were reunited, legends say that the sun did not\nset on the lands.  The light, a symbol, of the God's joy from the twin's\nreunification.  They have rarely been seen without the presence of the\nother since that day.  It is said that if you should attempt to separate\nthe brother and sister from each other that you will face the wrath of\nmortals unmatched since the days of Godot, the warrior born.\n"
