Euphratlarýn Kaynaðý~
You stand at the headwaters for the Euphrates. A dirty dry
wind blows across what is left of the once mighty river. Now all
you see are occasional puddles of bloody water. There is a vial
floating in the largest puddle of blood.

You are in the heart of Wormwood, where the flames are most
intense. A giant star lies on the ground here, glowing a hateful
red. All of the brush nearby has been blasted flat. A young boy
stands staring at the star. You ask him what happened, and he
says that an angel came, sounded a horn, and the star fell from
the sky. He was told that someone would come by the 5th horn to
get the key of david to unlock the pit.
